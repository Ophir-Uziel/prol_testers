In the above code, the image is converted to a blob and passed through the network using the forward() function. The output detections is a 4-D matrix, where

    The 3rd dimension iterates over the detected faces. (i is the iterator over the number of faces)
    The fourth dimension contains information about the bounding box and score for each face. For example, detections[0,0,0,2] gives the confidence score for the first face, and detections[0,0,0,3:6] give the bounding box.

The output coordinates of the bounding box are normalized between [0,1]. Thus the coordinates should be multiplied by the height and width of the original image to get the correct bounding box on the image.
